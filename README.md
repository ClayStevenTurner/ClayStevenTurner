# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ClayStevenTurner

At the moment, I primarily use Github in my free time to learn more python and explore innovations in machine learning. If you'd like to connect or get some work done together, please find me over on LinkedIn. 

Professionally, I am a product owner/manager. I have worked for large and small enterprises on projects as short as a single on-premise feature update to a full enterprise cloud platform launch. My daily workload is typically business-side because my strengths are in stakeholder and end user communication, product lifecycle management, roadmap/backlog refinement, and marketing/sales channel development but I am motivated by technological innovation and I really enjoy working with dev to flesh out use cases in technically actionable terms.
