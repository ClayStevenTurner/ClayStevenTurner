# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ClayStevenTurner

If you'd like to connect or get some work done together, please find me over on LinkedIn. 

Professionally, I am a product owner/manager. I have worked for large and small enterprises on projects as short as a single feature update to a full enterprise cloud platform launch. My strengths are in product lifecycle management, stakeholder and end user communication, roadmap/backlog refinement, and marketing/sales channel development. I am motivated by technological innovation and I really enjoy working with developers to flesh out use cases in technically actionable terms.
