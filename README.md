# 👋 Hi, I’m @ClayStevenTurner

At the moment, I primarily use Github in my free time to learn more python and explore innovations in machine learning. If you'd like to connect or get some work done together, please find me over on LinkedIn. 

Professionally, I am a product owner/manager. I have worked for large and small enterprises on projects as short as a single on-premise feature update to a full enterprise cloud platform launch. My daily workload is typically business-side because my strengths are in stakeholder and end user communication, product lifecycle management, roadmap/backlog refinement, and marketing/sales channel development but I am motivated by technological innovation and I really enjoy working with dev to flesh out use cases in technically actionable terms - Given ___, When ___, Then ___ - and then getting the satisfaction of seeing the feature meet a real user's needs.

I am so interested in the long-term product strategy that sometimes I find it hard to stop theorizing about future potential! Alas, that's what a time box is for and I'm grateful for Scrum/Kanban/Agile methodologies when they succeed at promoting shorter/fewer meetings and more efficient allocation of work time. 
   
👀 I’m interested in the practical implementation of NLP in augmented authorship solutions to solve and optimize business value delivery, as well as the ethical and sociological implications of widespread NLP use, especially how it may impact the market for/interest in/quality of creative prose.

🌱 I’m currently learning:

-	[Various Sources] Python for Machine Learning, Data Cleaning, and Data Visualization

-	[Stanford University via Youtube] Machine Learning (Andrew Ng)

-	[Stanford University via Youtube] Introduction to Natural Language Processing (Dan Jurafsky, Christopher Manning)

-	[Udemy] Python for Data Science and Machine Learning (Jose Portilla - Python/Pandas/NumPy/Seaborn/Matplotlib/Plotly/Scikit-learn)

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning projects in the natural language processing(NLP) space, especially as they relate to accelerated copywriting and long-form prose through augmented authorship tools. Web applications like Jasper AI(formerly Jarvis), Copy.ai, Rytr, and KoboldAI are positively fascinating to me.
